These indicators have been tailored for two different kinds of tourism activities; urban and beach tourism. The climatic suitability indicators consist of two indices; the Holiday Climate Index (HCI) rates the climate resources based on activities associated with urban tourism, while the Climate Index for Tourism (CIT) rates the climate resources based on activities associated with beach tourism.",,,1
